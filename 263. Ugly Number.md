Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `6, 8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int num) {
        while(num >= 2){
            if(num%2 == 0)
                num = num/2;
            else if(num % 3 ==0)
                num = num/3;
            else if(num % 5 ==0)
                num = num/5;
            else
                return false;
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
}
```

# Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if not num:
            return False
        for c in [2,3,5]:
            while num % c == 0:
                num //= c
        return True if num == 1 else False
```
