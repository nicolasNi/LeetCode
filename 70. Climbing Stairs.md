You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given n will be a positive integer.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n < 3)
            return n;
        int first = 1, second = 2, result = 0;
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++){
            result = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = result;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
