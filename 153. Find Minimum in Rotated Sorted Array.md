Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums){
        int start = 0, end = nums.length-1, mid = 0;
        while(nums[start] > nums[end]){
            mid = (start + end)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[end])
                start = mid + 1;
            else
                end = mid;
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```
